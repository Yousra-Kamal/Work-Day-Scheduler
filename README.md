# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This Work Day Scheduler helps you as an employee with a busy schedule to add important events to a daily planner so that you can manage your time effectively.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 

## How to Use

When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down you're presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present(red), or future(green).
To use the daily planner to create a schedule, click into a time block and enter a task. Then click the save button,
the text for that task will be saved in local storage.
